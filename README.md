## Introduction

This project's mission is to develop, test, and deploy automated machine learning-based methods to sift ('mine') through 
transit photometry data from exoplanet survey missions such as Kepler and TESS and inform subject matter experts (SMEs) 
on potential transiting planet candidates.

### Current main goals

The main goals of the `ExoMiner` pipeline are:

1. Perform classification of transit signals in Kepler and TESS data;
2. Create vetted catalogs of Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs) for Kepler and TESS sector runs/cycles.
3. Validate new exoplanets in Kepler and TESS.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline consists of the following main blocks:

1. Data wrangling: perform operations on the data products that are used to generate the datasets to train and evaluate
   the models, and to run inference. This set of code involves tasks such as creating transit signal tables used to
   preprocess the data, perform analysis of the data, and evaluate results and rankings produced by the models. Code
   under `data_wrangling`.
2. Data preprocessing: preprocess data products (e.g. light curve FITS files)
   to generate a catalog of transit signal features to be used for training and evaluating models, and to run inference
   on it. Code under `src_preprocessing`.
3. Model training: train models on the preprocessed data.
    1. Hyper-parameter optimization: find a set of optimized hyper-parameters by running Bayesian optimization (vanilla
       or [BOHB](https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter)), or random search. Code under `src_hpo`.
4. Model evaluation: evaluate model performance against a holdout test set or by K-fold CV. Code under `src`
   and `src_cv`. Other additional experiments are shown below.
    1. Label noise injection: add artificial label noise to the training set and study the impact on model performance
       on a fixed test set. Code under `label_noise`.
    2. Adjusting size of training set: selectively sample the training set and study the impact on model performance on
       a fixed test set. Code under `size_training_set`.
    3. Transfer learning to different datasets: perform transfer learning experiments to apply models across different
       datasets (e.g. from Kepler to TESS). This includes analyzing impact of certain input features in the model
       performance, and fine-tuning certain layers.
    4. Explainability: design explainability studies that (1) help in improving and finding blindspots of the model,
       and (2) provide interpretation for the researcher/SME on the model output.
5. Inference: run trained models on a generated catalog of transit signals to generate a ranking that can be used for
   vetoing transit signals or exoplanet validation. Code under `src`.

## Data

All data used in this project are publicly available. Generally, the data used consist of:

- TCE and Objects of Interest (e.g. KOI and TOI catalogs) tables available in archives/respositories such as
  [NExSci](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/),
  [ExoFOP](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/), [TEV](https://tev.mit.edu/data/) and
  [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/);
- Light curve and target pixel FITS files and other data products generated by the Science Processing Operations Center 
(SPOC) pipeline available in archives such as the [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/).

## Models

Models currently implemented in `models`:

1. `ExoMiner`: Multi-branch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) whose design is inspired in the different diagnostic
   tests used in the Data Validation (DV) module of the SPOC pipeline.

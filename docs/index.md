# Documentation Index

Welcome to the documentation for running the ExoMiner Pipeline using a Podman image. Below is an overview of the available resources to help you get started and troubleshoot any issues.

**Goal**: enable a seamless use of the ExoMiner Pipeline from TIC ID to prediction scores for the TESS Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) TCEs for the queried TIC IDs and sector runs. The pipeline can query SPOC TCEs from both 2-min and Full-Frame Image data. The required SPOC data products are downloaded from the [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/tess#section-36cad971-548d-4096-8252-5e6e2f341fed).
